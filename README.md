# TASK2
This is the task given to us on session 8 of DevOps Assembly lines. Here, we need to create 3 jobs on Jenkins - one for the download of data from the github, the 2nd one for deployment to another OS(the client's OS basically) and the third one for the work of the Quality Assurance Team which deploys the code into another system(the testing team basically). The OS of the testing system and the client's system needs to be same to avoid any errors. The total system should be end-to-end automated. We need to launch the OS using docker images(I used httpd) as instructed by sir. The local system is RHEL8.
